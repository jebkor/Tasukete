# Tasukete - A helping hand
Tasukete was created from the need of having a centralized package with which I had SCSS mixins and functions at the ready.
Tasukete is loosly translated to"help".

This NPM Package is my first attempt to use NPM as a way to store my generalized code. Feel free to use and improve it.
